# Contributing to OpsNerds

Thanks for being here.

Before contributing, understand this:
OpsNerds is built for real infrastructure work.
That affects how decisions get made.

---

## General Expectations

This project values:
- clarity over cleverness
- boring code over fragile code
- documentation that reflects reality
- changes that survive production use

If something only works in a demo, it’s not done.

---

## Code Style & Approach

- Prefer readability over abstraction
- Avoid unnecessary frameworks or layers
- Don’t optimize early unless there’s a real reason
- Assume someone else will maintain this later (because they will)

If you can’t explain why something exists, it probably shouldn’t.

---

## Features & Scope

OpsNerds is intentionally narrow.

If a feature:
- adds noise
- broadens the job scope
- turns this into a general marketplace
- solves a problem ops people don’t have

…it’s likely out of scope.

That’s not personal — it’s focus.

---

## Submitting Changes

When submitting a PR:
- explain *why* the change exists
- describe the real-world problem it solves
- keep changes scoped and readable

Big ideas are welcome.
Big rewrites without reason are not.

---

## Final Thought

OpsNerds is being built by people who’ve been paged.
That perspective matters.

If you bring that mindset, you’ll fit right in.
