# OpsNerds

**Infrastructure problems solved by people who actually run infrastructure.**

OpsNerds is a focused operations marketplace and platform for infrastructure work — built by operators, for operators.

This is not a general freelance site.  
This is not a gig economy experiment.  

If you need an app built, there are plenty of platforms for that.  
If you need an app to **work**, you’re in the right place.

## What Is OpsNerds?

OpsNerds connects infrastructure operators with real-world operational work, including:

- Network troubleshooting and redesign
- Linux and Windows server administration
- On-prem, hybrid, and cloud infrastructure
- Migrations, recoveries, and cleanup projects
- Monitoring, patching, and incident response
- Home labs, MSP environments, and enterprise stacks

If it runs, routes, stores, authenticates, or breaks — it belongs here.

## Why OpsNerds Exists

Infrastructure work is routinely buried under:
- unrelated job categories
- vague requirements
- mismatched expectations
- platforms that don’t understand ops work

Operators waste time explaining fundamentals.  
Clients waste time filtering noise.

OpsNerds is focused by design.

No translation layer required.  
Operators talk to operators.

## Philosophy

OpsNerds is built on a few simple beliefs:

- Infrastructure is not a commodity
- Operations is a discipline
- Experience matters more than buzzwords
- Real systems are messy
- Uptime is earned quietly
- Focus beats scale — until scale is earned

For the full philosophy, see [`/manifesto`](./MANIFESTO.md).
