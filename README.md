# OpsNerds

**Infrastructure problems solved by people who actually run infrastructure.**

OpsNerds is a focused operations marketplace and platform for infrastructure work — built by operators, for operators.

This is not a general freelance site.  
This is not a gig economy experiment.  

If you need an app built, there are plenty of platforms for that.  
If you need an app to **work**, you’re in the right place.

## What Is OpsNerds?

OpsNerds connects infrastructure operators with real-world operational work, including:

- Network troubleshooting and redesign
- Linux and Windows server administration
- On-prem, hybrid, and cloud infrastructure
- Migrations, recoveries, and cleanup projects
- Monitoring, patching, and incident response
- Home labs, MSP environments, and enterprise stacks

If it runs, routes, stores, authenticates, or breaks — it belongs here.

## Why OpsNerds Exists

Infrastructure work is routinely buried under:
- unrelated job categories
- vague requirements
- mismatched expectations
- platforms that don’t understand ops work

Operators waste time explaining fundamentals.  
Clients waste time filtering noise.

OpsNerds is focused by design.

No translation layer required.  
Operators talk to operators.

## Philosophy

OpsNerds is built on a few simple beliefs:

- Infrastructure is not a commodity
- Operations is a discipline
- Experience matters more than buzzwords
- Real systems are messy
- Uptime is earned quietly
- Focus beats scale — until scale is earned

For the full philosophy, see [`/manifesto`](./MANIFESTO.md).

## Standalone or Integrated

OpsNerds can run as a standalone platform or as part of the **MSPGuild ecosystem**.

- Standalone usage supported
- Shared identity and reputation via MSPGuild
- Designed for clean, intentional integration

One identity.  
Real operational history.  
Multiple surfaces.

## Project Status

**Early foundation / active build**

This repository currently represents:
- Core platform scaffolding
- Identity and role direction
- Modular design decisions
- Future MSPGuild integration points

Expect rapid iteration and structural changes while the foundation solidifies.

- Optional MSPGuild authentication

### V2
- Shared identity across MSPGuild modules
- Cross-module reputation
- Incident and on-call job types
- Operational history timelines
- Verified or invite-only operator tiers

## Who This Is For

OpsNerds is for:
- Systems administrators
- Infrastructure engineers
- Network operators
- MSP technicians
- Operators who’ve been on call and cleaned up messes

And for clients who want:
- fewer meetings
- faster resolution
- someone who already understands the problem

## Contributing

This project values:
- clarity over cleverness
- stability over novelty
- documentation that reflects reality

## Closing

OpsNerds exists for the people who keep things running —
even when nobody notices.

If it breaks, someone has to own it.
